\subsection{Monday, Mar 24: What is a Measure}
\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be a set and suppose $A\subseteq X,$ then we say that $\mu(A)$ is a measure of $A$ if:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\mu(A) \geq 0$ (it is fine if $\mu (A) = \infty$) 
        \item $\mu(A) \in \bbR$ (but we don't allow $\mu(A) = \pm \infty$, only one)
        \item ($\sigma-$additivity ) $\mu(\bigsqcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty\mu(A_i)$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}
\begin{exmp}
    The counting measure is the trivial example:
    \[\mu(A) = |A|.\]
    The length measure is 
    \[\mu(A) = V(A).\]
    In $\bbR,$ we could have that 
    \[\mu([a,b]) = b-a.\]
\end{exmp}
\begin{exmp} [H]
    The $4-$corner Cantor set has measure $0.$

\end{exmp}
\begin{prop}
    In $\bbR,$ a set $C\subset \bbR$ is a Cantor set if it is compact, nonempty, has empty interior, and has no isolated points. On a topological space, $C$ is a Cantor set if if it is non-empty, compact, Hausdorff, has no isolated points, and has a countable base of clopen sets.In a nonempty, Hausdotff, topological space, then if a set is compact, metrizable, and has no isolated points, then it is the continuous image of a Cantor set. In every complete metric space without isolated points, there is a Cantor set.
\end{prop}

The following few proofs and remarks deal with the Banach-Tarski Paradox.
