\subsection{Tuesday, Jan 21: Continuous Functions and Homeomorphisms}
\begin{defn}
    We say $X$ and $Y$ are \textbf{homeomorphic} if there exits some $f: X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$ which are both continuous such that $f\circ g: Y\to Y$ is identity on $Y$ and $g\circ f: X \to X$ is the identity on $X.$

    We say that $f$ and $g$ are \textbf{homeomorphisms}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Suppose $f: X\to Y$ is injective, then we say $f$ is an \textbf{embedding} if $f$ unto its image is a homeomorphism.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
    To give a non-example, we let $X = [0,2\pi)$ and $Y = \bbR^2,$ and we define 
    $f; X\to Y$ by sending $X$ to the unit circle: 
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Images/Pughnonexample.png}
    \end{figure}
\end{rem}
\begin{thm}
    We assert that:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Constant functions are continuous.
        \item If $A \subset X$ and $i$ is the inclusion of $A$ as a subset of $X.$ That is, $i$ is an injective map from $A \to X,$ then $i$ continuous. 
        \item Suppose $f: X\to Y$ and $g: Y\to Z,$ then if $f$ and $g$ are continuous, then $f \circ g$ is continuous.
        \item Suppose $A\subset X$ and $f: X\to Y$ is continuous, then $f|_A: A \to Y$ is continuous.
        \item Suppose $f: X\to Y,$ where $Y\subset Z,$ then if $f$ is continuous, then $\hat{f}: X\to Z$ is continuous.
        \item Suppose $X= \bigcup U_\alpha,$ where $U_\alpha$ is open for each $\alpha.$ If $f: X\to Y$ such that $f|_{U_\alpha}: U_\alpha \to Y$ is continuous for each $\alpha,$ then $f$ is continuous.
        \item Suppose $X = A \cup B,$ where $A,B$ are closed. Suppose we have  $f: X\to Y$ such that $f|_A$ and $f|_B$ are both continuous, then $f$ is continuous.
        \item We say $f: Y \to \prod X_\alpha$ is continuous if and only if the ``coordinate functions," $f_\alpha = \prod_\alpha f$ is continuous for all $\alpha.$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    We give a proof for (f): Let $U$ be an open set in $Y.$ By continuity of each $f$ restriction, we have that $f^{-1}|_{U_\alpha}(U)$ is open in $U_\alpha.$
    Notice that $f^{-1}|_{U_\alpha}(U) = f^{-1}(U) \cap U_\alpha,$ which is open in both $U_\alpha$ and in $X$ (since the intersection of open is open). Moreover, we have that 
    \[f^{-1}(U) = \bigcup(f^{-1}(U) \cap U_\alpha),\] which is open in $X.$

    Proof of (g): Suppose $K\subset Y$ is closed, then $f^{-1}|_A(K)$ is closed in $A$ and thus closed in $X,$ similarly for $B.$ Then 
    \[f^{-1}(K) = f^{-1}|_A(K) \cup f^{-1}|_B (K)\] is closed.
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}
    Note that (f) is not true if we replace $U_\alpha$ for closed sets. To see this, take $X = \bigcup K_\alpha,$ where $K_\alpha$ is each point in $X.$ Then there are a lot of examples.
\end{rem}
\begin{defn}
    Suppose $X$ is a set and $(Y,d)$ is a metric space. We say a sequence of functions $\{f_n : X\to Y\}$ converges uniformly to $f: X\to Y$ if for all $\epsilon>0,$ there exists an $N\in \bbN$ such that  if $n\geq N,$ we have that 
    \[d(f_n(x) - f(x))< \epsilon, \quad \forall x\in X \iff ||f - f_n|| < \epsilon.\]
\end{defn}
\begin{thm}
    Let $f_n: X\to Y$ be continuous, where $X$ is a set and $(Y,d)$ is a metric space. If $f_n \to f$ uniformly, then $f$ is continuous.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $V\subset Y$ be open. Let $x\in f^{-1}(V).$ We want to find some open $U\subset f^{-1}(V)$ such that $x\in U.$ That is, $f(U)\subset V.$ Let $f(x) = y.$  Since $V$ is open, then there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $B_\epsilon(y)\subset V.$ Now we want to find an open neighborhood of $x$ such that its image is contained in this ball. By uniform convergence, there exists an $N$ such that if $n\geq N,$ we have that $d(f_n(x), f(x))< \frac{\epsilon}{3}$ for all $x\in X.$ Since $f_N$ is continuous, then there exists a $x\in U$ such that $f_N(U)\subset B_\frac{\epsilon}{3}(f_N(x)).$ Thus, for all $y\in U:$
    \[d(f(y), f_N(y))< \frac{\epsilon}{3}, \quad d(f_N(y), f_N(x)) < \frac{\epsilon}{3}, \quad d(f_N(x), f(x))< \frac{\epsilon}{3}.\]
\end{proof}

\subsection{Thursday, Jan 23: Connectedness}
\begin{defn}
    A \textbf{separation} of a topological space $X$ is a decomposition 
    \[X = A \sqcup B\] such that $A,B$ are both open and nonempty.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    A topological space $X$ is \textbf{connected} if it does not admit a separation.
\end{defn}
\begin{lemma}
    $X$ is connected if and only if, whenever we write $X = A \sqcup B,$ where $A$ and $B$ are nonempty, then either $A \cap B' \neq \emptyset$ or $A' \cap B \neq \emptyset.$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $X$ is connected, then without loss of generality, $A$ is not closed. Thus, \[A' \not \subset A \implies A' \cap B \neq \emptyset.\] If, on the other hand, $X$ is disconnected, then $A$ and $B$ are both closed, and thus \[A' \cap B = A \cap B' = A \cap B = \emptyset.\]
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
    Suppose $X = C\sqcup D,$ where $C,D$ are both open. Suppose that $Y\subset X$ is connected in the subspace topoogy, then either $Y\subset C$ or $Y\subset D.$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Consider that 
    \[Y = Y\cap C \sqcup Y\cap D,\] where both of the terms in the right are open in $Y$ because both $C$ and $D$ are open. Thus, by connectedness of $Y,$ at least one of these must be empty.
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
    Suppose $X = \bigcup_\alpha X_\alpha,$ where every $X_\alpha$ is connected and there exists some $p \in \bigcap X_\alpha,$ then $X$ is connected.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $X = A\sqcup B,$ both open. By Lemma 2, we have that for all $\alpha,$ we have that either $X_\alpha \subset A$ or $X_\alpha \subset B.$ Without loss of generality, $p \in A,$ and thus $X_\alpha \subset A$ for all $\alpha,$ and thus $B$ is empty.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
    Suppose $A \subset X,$ where $A$ is connected. If $A\subset B \subset \overline{A},$ then $B$ is connected.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $B = C \sqcup D,$ where $C,D$ open and nonempty. Since $A$ is connected, then by lemma 2, without loss of generality, we can say that $A\subset C.$ Thus, $\overline{A}\subset \overline{C} = C,$ which is disjoint from $D,$ and thus 
    \[B \cap D = \emptyset.\]
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
    Suppose $X$ is connected and $f: X\to Y$ is continuous. Then $f(X)$ is connected.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $f(X) = A\sqcup B,$ $A,B$ nonempty and open. Since $f$ is continuous, then $X = f^{-1}(A)\sqcup f^{-1}(B),$ where they are both open by continuity and nonempty by surjectivity.  
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
    Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are connected, then $X \times Y$ is connected.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $x\in X.$ We claim that $\{x\}\times Y$ is homeomorphic to $Y.$ The homeomorphism is $\pi,$ the projection map. Thus, $A_x = \{x\}\times Y$ is connected. Similarly, $B_x = X \times \{y\}$ is connected for every $y \in Y.$ Thus, since $T_{x,y} = A_x \cap B_x = (x,y),$ then by Theorem 3, we have that 
    \[X = \bigcup_{y \in Y} T_{x,y}\] is connected.
\end{proof}
We can obviously extend this to a finite product of connected spaces. What about for infinite products?

\begin{defn}
    Let $X_\alpha$ be a collection of spaces. We say that the \textbf{box topology} on $\prod X_\alpha$ is the topology separated by the basis 
    \[B  = \{\prod U_\alpha, \; : \; U_\alpha \subset X_\alpha \; \text{is open}\}.\].
\end{defn}
\begin{exmp}
    $\bbR^N$ is connected in the product topology but not connected in the box topology. To see this, think of $\bbR^ = \{(x_1, x_2, \dots) \; : \; x_i \in \bbR\}$ and think of $\bbR^N = \text{bounded sequences} \sqcup \text{unbounded sequences}.$ We claim that these are both open in the box topology: Let $a \in \text{bounded sequence}.$ Thus, there exists some $C$ such that for all $a_i,$ $a_i \leq C.$ Consider 
    \[U_i = (x_1 - 1, x_1 + 1)\times (x_2 - 1, x_2 + 1)\times \cdots,\] which is an open set, and is a basis element in the box topology since every point in $U_i$ is bounded by $C + 1.$ An identical argument proves that $\{\text{unbounded sequences}\}$ are unbounded. Thus, $\bbR^N$ is not connected in the box topology. 
\end{exmp}

\begin{thm}
    Suppose $X_\alpha$ is any collection of connected spaces, then $\prod X_\alpha$ is connected in the product topology.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    It suffices to find a connected $K \subset X$ such that for every open $U \subset X,$ we have that $K \cap U \neq \emptyset.$ To find this, we will use Theorem 3. let $x\in X,$ where $x = (x_\alpha)_\alpha.$ Let $I$ be a finite set of indices, and define \[K_i := \{y \; : \; y_\alpha = x_\alpha, \quad \alpha \notin I\}.\] We remark that $K_I$ is homeomorphic to $\prod_{\alpha \in I} X_\alpha$ under the projection homeomorphism. $\prod_{I}X_\alpha$ is connected by Theorem 3, and thus $K_I$ is connected and contains $x.$ 
    \[K = \bigcup_{\text{all finite $I$ index sets}}K_I\] is connected again by Theorem 3. For any nonempty open basis in the product topology $U\subset X,$ we claim that $K\cap U \neq \emptyset.$ To see this, let $U = \prod U_\allowdisplaybreaks,$ where $U_\alpha = X_\alpha$ except for finitely many indices ($I$). Since each $U_\alpha$ is nonempty, then for $\alpha \in I,$ we choose some $u_\alpha \in U_\alpha.$ And for $\alpha \notin I,$ then choose $u_\alpha = x_\alpha.$ It is not hard to see that $u_\alpha \in K$ and that $u_\alpha \in U.$ Thus, $X$ is connected.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Tuesday, Jan 28: Compactness}
\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be a space, and let $x,y \in X.$ A \textbf{path} in $X$ is defined to be the continuous map $f: [0,1] \to X$ such that
    \[f(0) = x, \qquad f(1) = y.\]
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    A space $X$ is \textbf{path connected} if for any $x, y \in X,$ there is a path in $X$ from $x$ to $y.$
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
    If $X$ is path connected, then $X$ is connected.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Consider that $f([0,1])\subset X$ is a connected subspace of $X$ by the continuity of $f.$ Let $x \in X.$ For any $y\in Y,$ choose the path $f_y$ such that $f_y(0) = x$ and $f_y(1)= y.$ Let $P_y:= f_y([0,1])\subset X.$ Since $y\in P_y$ for all $y,$ then $X = \bigcup_y P_y,$ and since $x\in P_y$ for all $y,$ then $X$ is connected.
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}
    The converse fails, see 
    \[X = \sin(\frac{1}{x}) \cup [0,1]\]
\end{rem}

\begin{thm}
    (IVT) Let $X$ be connected and let $f: X\to \bbR$ be continuous. If $a,b \in X$ and there exists some $c\in [f(a), f(b)],$ then there exists some $\gamma \in [a,b]$ such that $f(\gamma) = c.$
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose not, then $c \notin f(X),$ then $f(X)\subset [-\infty, c) \cup (c, \infty].$ Both of these sets are open, and thus the inverses are open and disjoint. Neither is empty and we get that their union is all of $X.$ Thus, $X$ is not connected, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
    We say that $X$ is \textbf{compact} if any open cover has a finite open subcover.
\end{defn}
\begin{exmp}
We give some examples.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\bbR$ is not compact. Let $\{(-n, n)\}_{n\in \bbN}$ be the open cover of $\bbR.$ Obviously there is no finite subcover (say, of cardinality $N$), since then there would exist some $(-N, N)$ that does not contain $N \in \bbR.$
        \item $(0,1)$ is not compact since it is homeomorphic to $\bbR.$
        \item $[0,1]$ is compact. To see this, let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be a cover of $X.$ Thus, $0 \in U_\alpha$ for some $\alpha,$ and thus there exists some $p>0$ such that $B_p(0) = [0,p)\subset U_\alpha$ for some $\alpha.$ Since $p\in X,$ then $p\in U_\beta,$ and thus there exists some $q>p$ such that $[0,q]\subset U_\alpha \cup U_\beta.$ Define 
        \[p = \sup\{q \; \: [0,q) \subset \text{finite subcover}\},\] we claim that $p = 1.$ Suppose that $p<1,$ then $p\in [0,1]$ and so $p\in U_\beta$ for some $\beta.$ By definition, there must exist some $q$ such that $[0,q]\subset \{U_i\}.$ But then we see that since $p\in U_\beta,$ and $U_\beta$ is open, then $(p-\epsilon, p+\epsilon)\subset U_\beta,$ but then $\{U_i\} \cup U_\beta \supset [0, p + \frac{\epsilon}{2}] \ni q,$ which is a contradiction to the size of $p.$  
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exmp}

\begin{rem}
    To see that $X$ is compact, it suffices to show that every open cover of $X$ by basis elements has a finite subcover.
\end{rem}

\begin{thm}
    If $X$ is compact and $Y\subset X$ is closed, then $Y$ is compact.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover of $Y.$ Then we have that for every $\alpha,$ there exist some open $V_\alpha \in X$ such that $V_\alpha \cap Y = U_\alpha.$ Then we have that $Y \subset V_\alpha.$ Moreover, since $Y$ is closed, then $X\setminusm Y$ is open in $X,$ and so 
    \[\bigcup V_\alpha \cup (X\setminusm Y) \supset X.\] By the compactness of $X,$ we have a finite subset $\{V_{\alpha_i}\}\cup (X\setminus Y) \supset X,$ and thus intersecting with $Y$ gives an open finite subcover of $X.$
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
    Suppose $f$ is Hausdorff. If $Y\subset X$ is compact, then $Y$ is closed.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    It suffices to show that for every $x\in X\setminus Y,$ there exists some $r>0$ such that $B_r(x) \cap Y = \emptyset.$ Fix $x\in X \setminus Y.$ Since $X$ is Hausdorff, then for all $y\in Y,$ there exists a set $V_y\ni y$ and $W_y \ni x$ such that $V_y \cap W_y = \emptyset.$ Clearly, $\{V_y\}$ is an open cover, and thus let $\{V_{y_i}\}$ be the open finite subcover. Moreover, we have that 
    \[\bigcup V_{y_i} \cap \bigcap W_{y_i} = \emptyset.\] Since $x\in W_{y_i}$ for all $x,$ and each is open, then the finite intersection is open. Thus, we have that $Y \cap \bigcap W_{y_i} = \emptyset$ and $\bigcap W_{y_i} \ni x.$
\end{proof}
\begin{cor}
    If $X$ is compact and Hausdorff and $Y\subset X$ is closed, then $Y$ is compact. Moreover, for any $x\in X\setminus Y,$ there exist open $V \supset Y$ and $x\in U$ such that $V\cap U = \emptyset.$
\end{cor}
This corollary separates a closed set from a point, and we say $X$ is \textbf{regular}. We say $X$ is \textbf{normal} if it separates from closed sets in $Y \setminus X.$

\begin{thm}
    Suppose $f: X\to Y$ be continuous with $X$ compact. Then $f(X)$ is compact.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\{U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover of $f(X).$ Then $\{f^{-1}(U_\alpha)\}$ is an open cover of $X,$ and thus $\{f^{-1}(U_{\alpha_i})\}$ is a finite open cover with 
    \[X \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^n f^{-1}(U_{\alpha_i}) \implies f(X) \subset \bigcup_{i=1}^n U_{\alpha_i}.\]
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
    Suppose $f: X\to Y$ is a continuous bijection with $X$ compact and $Y$ Hausdorff. Then $f$ is a homeomorphism.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    We have that $f^{-1}$ is continuous if and only if $f(F)$ is closed ($F$ closed). Let $K\subset X$ be closed, then $K$ is compact, and thus $f(K)$ is compact, and thus since $Y$ is closed, then $f(K)$ is closed. 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Tuesday, Feb 4: Applications of Tychonoff's Theorem}
\begin{exmp}
    Suppose $X$ is equipped with the discrete topology. Then if we say that 
    \[\beta X = \overline{F(X)}\subset \prod \text{Compact spaces with upper bound on card. and exist continuous function from X}.\] Then 
    \[\beta X = \text{ultrafilters on X}.\] For all $A\subset X, U_A\subset \beta X,$ where 
    \[U_A := \{\mathcal{F}\; ; \; A\subset \mathcal{F}\}.\] We claim that $\{U_A\}$ is a basis for a topology. 
    \[X\to \beta X\]
    \[x \to \{\mathcal{F_x} \; \text{principal ultrafilter gen by $x$}\}\]
\end{exmp}
\begin{prop}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item This map is homeomorphic
        \item $\beta X$ is compact and Hausdorff
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{exmp}
    Supose $X = \bbN,$ then an example from $X$ to a compact Hausdorff space is $N\xrightarrow{a} [-C,C],$ where $|a_i| \leq C.$
\end{exmp}
\begin{rem}
    (Universal Property) Any $a: \bbN \to [-C, C]$ admits a continuous extension from 
    \[\beta a: \beta \bbN \to [-C, C].\] Let $\omega \in \beta \bbN$ be a non-principal ultrafilter. Then to find $\beta a(\omega),$ split $[-C, C] = [-C, 0] \cup (0, C],$ then if $C = 1:$
    \[\bbN = a^{-1}[-1,0] \sqcup a^{-1}(0,1].\] Suppose $a^{-1}(0,1] \in \omega, $ then split $(0,1] = (0,\frac{1}{2}] \cup (\frac{1}{2}, 1],$ and suppose $a^{-1}(\frac{1}{2}, 1] \in \omega.$ Keep going iteratively, and we find that $\beta a(\omega)$ is this limit.
\end{rem}

\begin{exmp}
    (Profinite Completions of groups) Let $G$ be a group. Let $\phi_i : G \to F$ be all homeomorphisms, where $F$ is a compact finite group. Then

\begin{defn}
    A \textbf{continuum} is a nonempty compact connected metrizable space (the topology was induced by a metric)
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    A continuum $K$ is \textbf{indecomposable} if whenever $K = A \cup B$, where $A,B$ are continuum, then either $A = K$ or $B = K$ (or both.)

    We claim that $K$ is indecomposable.
    \begin{prop}
        Suppose $Q_n$ is a nested family of continua. Then $Q_\infty = \bigcap Q_n$ is a continua.
    \end{prop}
    \begin{proof}
        We know that $Q_\infty$ is compact and metrizable and nonempty by properties of compactness. Suppose $Q_\infty = A \sqcup B$ where they're both nonempty and closed in $Q_\infty\subset Q_0.$ Since $Q_0$ is metrizable, then $A,B$ are compact and disjoint in $Q_0,$ and so there exists an $\epsilon>0$ such that $d(A, B) > \epsilon.$ Thus there exist disjoint open in $Q_0$  $A\subset U$ and $B\subset V$ such that $U\cap V = \emptyset.$ Define
        \[F_n := Q_n - (U\cup V) = Q_n \cap (Q_0 - (U\cup V))\] and so 
        \[\bigcap F_n = \emptyset\]
        so some $F_n$ is empty, and so $Q_n \subset U \sqcup V,$ and so $(Q_n \cap U) \sqcup (Q_n \cap V)$ is separated and so $Q_n$ is not connected.

\begin{defn}
    Let $(X_i)$ be a sequence of continua such that for all $i\geq 1,$ 
    \[f_{i+1}: X_{i+1}\to X_i\] is a sequence of continuous surjective maps. Then we define 
    \[X_\infty := \lim_{\leftarrow}(X_i, f_i) = \{x_i \in \prod X_i \; ; \; x_i = f_{i+1}\; \forall i\}\] as the \textbf{inverse limit}, as a subset of $\prod X_i.$ 
\end{defn}
 \[ \cdots \xrightarrow{} X_3 \xrightarrow{f_3} X_2 \xrightarrow{f_2} X_1.\] 
 \begin{thm}
     $X_\infty$ is a continuum and if $A_\infty \subset X_\infty$ is a sub-continuum, then $A = \lim_{\leftarrow}(A_i, g_{i+1})$ where $A_i = \pi_i(A), g_{i+1} = f_{i+1} |_{A_{i+1}}$
 \end{thm}
 \begin{proof}
     Define 
     \[Q_{n,i} := \{(x_i) \in \prod X_i \; ; \; x_i = f_{i+1}(x_{i+1}), \; \forall i \in [n]\}.\] Since $Q_n \approx \prod_{i\geq n} X_i,$ then $Q_n$ is nonempty, compact, Hausdorff, and connected. -

    (a) If $X$ is regular, then there exists some open set $U$ containing $x.$ Thus, $X\setminus U$ is closed and disjoint from $\{x\}.$ By  regularity, there exists $V\ni u$ open such that $W \supset X\setminus U$ open and $V\cap W = \emptyset.$ We have that $V \supset X\setminus W,$ the latter of which is closed, and thus $\overline{V}\subset X\setminus W \subset U$

    Let $x\in X,$ and suppose $K\subset X$ is closed with $x\notin K.$ $X\setminus K = U$ is open and contains $x,$ and thus by assumption, there exists some $V\ni x$ such that $\overline{V} \subset U,$ and thus $X\setminus \overline{V}$ is open and contains $K$ and is disjoint from $V.$ 

    (b) Replace $x$ with $A$ above.
\end{proof}
\begin{thm}
    The following hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff. Moreover, an arbitrary product of Hausdorff spaces is Hausdorff
        \item A subspace of a regular space is regular and an arbitrary product of regular spaces is regular.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{rem}
    The subspace of a normal space is not necessarily normal, and the product of normal spaces is not necessarily normal.
\end{rem}
\begin{proof}
    (b) Suppose $X$ is our regular space, and $Y\subset X$ is a subspace. Suppose $y\in X$ and $A\subset Y$ is closed and $\{x\}\cap A = \emptyset.$ Thus, $A = Y \cap K$ for some $K\subset X$ closed. So then $\{x\}\cap K = \emptyset,$ and so there exists $U\ni x$ and $V\supset K$ both open and disjoint. Then $Y\cap U$ and $Y\cap V$ are both open and disjoint, and we are done.

    Suppose $\{X_\alpha\}$ are all regular, then they are Hausdorff, and so $X = \prod X_\alpha$ are all Hausdorff, and so points are closed. Let $x = (x_\alpha)\in X.$ Then if $U\ni x$ open (where $U$ is a basis). Thus, for all $\alpha,$ $x_\alpha \in U_\alpha \subset X_\alpha,$ and there exists $x_\alpha \in V_\alpha \subset U_\alpha$ where $\overline{V_\alpha}\subset U_\alpha.$ Evidently, $V = \prod V_\alpha,$ and $V\ni x,$ and we claim that 
    \[\overline{V} = \overline{\prod V_\alpha} = \prod \overline{V_\alpha}\subset \prod U_\alpha = U\]
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
    If $X$ is regular with a countable basis, then $X$ is normal.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\cal B$ be a countable basis. Let $A,B$ be closed disjoint subsets of $X.$ For all $x\in A,$ $x\in X\setminus B$ open, and thus there exist $U_x\ni x$ such that $\overline{U_x}\subset X\setminus B.$ Without loss of generality, we can assume $U_x$ is a basis element. Since $\cal B$ is countable, we can find $W_1, W_2, \dots$ basis elements such that $\overline{W_i} \cap B = \emptyset$ for all $i,$ and $\bigcup W_i \supset A.$ Similarly for $B$, there exists $V_1, V_2, \dots$ such that $\overline{V_i} \cap A = \emptyset$ for all $i$ and $\bigcup V_i \supset B.$

    Let \[W_1' := W_1\setminus \overline{V_1} = W_1 \cap (\overline{V_1}^c), \quad V_1' = V_1 \cap (\overline{W_1}^c),\] and note both are open and $A\cap W_1 = A\cap W_1'$ and similarly for $V_1'$. Define
    \[W_2' = W_2 \cap \overline{V_1}^c \cap \overline{V_2}^c, \quad V_2' = V_2 \cap \overline{W_1}^c \cap \overline{W_2}^c\] Build this recursively. The for any $n,$ $W_n'$ is disjoint from $V_j'$ with $j\leq n$ and $V_n'$ is disjoint from $W_j'$ with $j\leq n.$ Define 
    \[W:= \bigcup W_i'\supset A, \qquad V:= \bigcup V_i'\supset B\] open and disjoint.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
    Every metric space is normal.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $X$ is a metric space induced by the topology and let $A, B$ be disjoint closed sets. For all $a\in A,$ ther exists an $\epsilon_a >0$ such that 
    \[B_{\epsilon_a}(a) \cap B  = \emptyset, \qquad B_{\epsilon_b}(b) \cap A  = \emptyset\]
    Let \[U := \bigcup_{a\in A} B_{\frac{\epsilon_a}{2}}(a), \quad V := \bigcup_{b\in B} B_{\frac{\epsilon_b}{2}}(b)\] Both are open. Suppose $x\in U \cap V,$ then $v\in B_{\frac{\epsilon_a}{2}}(a) \cap B_{\frac{\epsilon_b}{2}}(b),$ for some $a\in A,$ $b\in B,$ and thus 
    \[d(a,b)\leq d(a,x) + d(x,b) < \epsilon = \min\{\epsilon_a, \epsilon_b\} \implies b \in B_{\epsilon_a}(a).\]
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
    Compact Hausdorff spaces are normal. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    Let $A,B$ be closed disjoint sets. For all $a\in A,$ there exists $U_a\ni a$ and $V_a \supset B$ open and disjoint. 
    \[A \subset \bigcup_{a\in A} U_a \implies A\subset \bigcup_{i=1}^N U_{a_i} =:U.\] Moreover, 
    \[V:=\bigcap_{i=1}^N V_{a_i}\supset B.\] $U$ and $V$ are open disjoint. 
\end{proof}
\begin{rem}
    To recap:
    For compact $X,$ the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $X$ is regular
        \item $X$ is Hausdorff
        \item $X$ is normal
    \end{enumerate}
    For second countable $X$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $X$ is regular
        \item $X$ is normal
        \item $X$ is metrizable.
    \end{enumerate}
    Thus, we have yet to prove the last equivalence.
\end{rem}
\begin{lemma}
    (Urysohn's Lemma) Let $X$ be normal, $A, B \subset X$ be closed and disjoint. Then there exists a continuous function $f: X\to [0,1]$ such that $f(A) = 0$ and $f(B) = 1.$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $P = \bbQ \cap [0,1].$ For each $p \in P,$ we want to find some $U_p$ open such that $A\subset U_0,$ $U_1 = X\setminus B,$ and if $p < q,$ then $\overline{U_p}\subset U_q.$

    Let $U_1 = X\setminus B$ and since $A\subset U_1,$ then by normality, there exists some $A\subset U_0$ such that $\overline{U_0}\subst U_1.$ By normality, there exists some open $\overline{U_0}\subset U_\frac{1}{2}$ such that $\overline{U_\frac{1}{2}}\subset U_1.$ Keep going with the fairy rationals. Let $U_\frac{p}{q} = X$ if $\frac{p}{q} >1,$ and Define 
    \[f(x): = \inf\{\frac{p}{q}\text{ such that } x\in U_\frac{p}{q}\}.\] We claim that $f$ is our function.

\begin{thm}
    Suppose $X$ is regular with a countable basis. Then $X$ is metrizable.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
    We use Urysohn's Lemma. For all $x\in X,$ for all $U$ open, there exists $f: X\to [0,1]$ continuous such that $f(x) = 1$ and $f(X^c) = 0.$

    We claim that if $X$ is completely regular, then there exists an embedding from $X\mapsto [0,1]^J,$ for some $J$ index set In fact, $X$ completely regular and a countable basis implies there exist an embedding from $X\mapsto [0,1]^N.$ It suffices to show this, since $X$ would be homeomorphic to a subset of a metric space.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $X$ is compltely regular the for all $x\in X,$ for all $U \ni x$ open, then we choose $f: X \to [0,1]$ with $f(x) = 1$ and $f(X^c) = 0.$ We take these $f$ to be the coordinates of 
        \[F: X \to [0,1]^J.\] If $x\neq y,$ then we can choose $x\in U$ and $y\notin U$ such that $f(x) = 1$ and $f(y)  = 0,$ and so the map is injective. $F$ is continuous and injective, to show that $F$ is a homeomorphism unto its image, we want to show that $F^{-1}: F(X) \to X$ is continuous. That is, for all $U \subset X$ is open, then $F(U)\subset F(X)$ is open. That is, we want to show that $F(U) = F(X) \cap V,$ $V\subset [0,1]^N$ is open. Let $F(x) \in F(U)$ for some $x\in U.$ We want to find some open $W = F(X) \cap V$ such that  $F(x) \in W.$ Let \[V := \pi_f^{-1}((0,1]) \subset \prod_J [0,1],\] which is obviously open, then $F(x)\in V\cap F(X)\subset F(U)$
        \item If $F$ has a countable basis, then we claim that we can find a countable set $f_n: X\to [0,1]$ continuous such that for all $x\in X,$ for all $U\ni x,$ open, there exists some $n$ such that $f_n(x) = 1$ and $f_n(X^c) = 0.$ Let $\{U_i\}$ be a countable basis, and suppose $x\in U$ open. Then $x\in U_i \subset U,$ then since $X$ is regular, $x \in \overline{U_j}\subset U_i \subset U.$ Define $f_{i,j}: X\to [0,1]$ such that $f_{i,j}(\overline{U_j}) = 1$ and $f_{i,j}(U_i^c) = 0.$
        \item Take $f_{i,j}$ from above as the coordinates of $F,$ and so $F: X\to [0,1]^N$ is a homeomorphism unto its image. Thus, $X$ is metrizable.  
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
    Let $\overline{X} = \overline{F(X)}\subset [0,1]^J.$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\overline{X}$ is compact and Hausdorff.
        \item If $X\subset \overline{X}$ is dense and $X$ has subspace topology.
        \item For all $f: X\to [0,1],$ there exists a unique $\overline{f}: \overline{X}\to [0,1].$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{lemma}
    Suppose $\overline{X}$ is compact and Hausdorff. Then $\overline{f}: \overline{X}\to [0,1]$ and $\overline{f}|_X = f,$ then $\overline{f}$ is defined by $f.$ That is, the extension is unique.
\end{lemma}

\begin{thm} (Stone-\^{C}ech compactication)
    Let \( X \) be a completely regular space. There exists a compact Hausdorff space \( \beta X \) and a homeomorphism mapping \( X \) into a dense subset of \( \beta X \) such that if \( f \) is a bounded continuous function from \( X \) to \( \mathbb{R} \), then \( f \) has a bounded continuous extension to \( \beta X \).
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}
    (Alexandroff- Hausdorff) Let $X$ be Hausdorff, the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There is a continuous surjective map $f: C\to X$
        \item $X$ is nonempty, compact, and metrizable.
        \item $X$ is nonempty, compact, and has a countable basis.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{rem}
    For a compact Hausdorff $X,$ metrizable is equivalent to $X$ having a countable basis from before.
\end{rem}

\begin{lemma}
    Suppose $f: A\to B$ is continuous and surjective. If $A$ is compact and metrizable, and $B$ is Hausdorff, then $B$ is compact and metrizable.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    It suffices to show that $B$ has a countable basis. Let $\cal U_n$ be a countable basis for $A.$ Let $\cal U'_k$ be another countable basis for $A$ such that each $U_i' = \displaystyle\bigcup_{j=1}^N U_j.$ Define 
    \[V_i := B - f(A - U_i').\] We claim that $\{V_i\}$ is a basis for $B.$ $V_i$ is obviously open. Let $b\in B.$ Let $b\in V\subset B$ be open. It suffices to find some $V_i \in \{V_i\}$ such that $b\in V_i \subset V \subset B.$ $f^{-1}(\{b\})$ is compact and contained in $f^{-1}(V)$ open. For all $a\in f^{-1}(\{b\}),$ $a\in U_j$ for $U_j \subset f^{-1}(V).$ By compactness, there exist finitely many of these, $U_i$ so take the union to make $U_i'$ and thus 
    \[f^{-1}(\{b\}) \subset U_i' \subset f^{-1}(V)\implies A - f^{-1}(\{b\}) \supset A - U_i' \supset A - f^{-1}(V) \implies f(A - f^{-1}(\{b\})) \supset f(A - U_i') \supset f(A - f^{-1}(V))\] and so 
    \[ B - f(A - f^{-1}(\{b\})) \subset B - f(A - U_i') \subset B - f(A - f^{-1}(V))\] and it can be shown that this is equivalent to
    \[\{b\} \subset V_i \subset V\]
\end{proof}
\begin{proof} (Alexandroff-Hausdorff)
    Suppose $f: X\to X$ is continuous and surjective, then clearly, $X$ is nonempty and $X$ is compact. We claim that $X$ has a countable basis, which is obvious from our lemma.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
    Suppose $X$ is Hausdorff. Let $x\in X.$ The \textbf{connected component} of $X$ containing $x$ is the \textbf{maximal connected} subset of $X$ containing $x.$ 
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
    This is equivalent to saying that 
    \[\text{component} = \bigcup Q \quad \text{st } Q\subset X \text{ is connected}\]
\end{rem}

\begin{defn}
    $X$ is totally disconnected if every connected component is a single point.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    $X$ is \textbf{perfect} if no point is open.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
    $X$ is perfect if for all $x\in X,$ for all $U\ni u$ open, there exists $y\in U - x.$ That is, there are no isolated points.
\end{rem}

\begin{prop}
    Suppose $X = \displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^\infty X_i,$ where each $X_i$ is finite, nonempty, and is equipped with the discrete topology. Then $X$ is compact, nonempty, metrizable, and totally disconnected. Moreover, if infinitely many $X_i$ have more than $1$ point, then $X$ is perfect
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Compact comes from Tychonoff. $X$ is metrizable from before. $X$ is obviously nonempty. To show that $X$ is totally disconnected
    
\end{proof}
